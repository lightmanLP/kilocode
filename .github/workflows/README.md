# Security automation

Workflows that automate dependency remediation and give the team Slack visibility into security findings, without depending on the private `Kilo-Org/cloud` Security Agent stack.

| File | Trigger | Manual run |
|---|---|---|
| `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` | `schedule`: hourly, plus `workflow_dispatch` | Actions tab → "Dependabot auto-merge" → Run workflow, or `gh workflow run dependabot-auto-merge.yml` |
| `security-findings-notify.yml` | `schedule`: every 6 hours, plus `workflow_dispatch` | Actions tab → "Security findings notify" → Run workflow, or `gh workflow run security-findings-notify.yml` |
| `stale-bot-pr-notify.yml` | `schedule`: daily at 13:00 UTC, plus `workflow_dispatch` | Actions tab → "Stale bot PR notify" → Run workflow, or `gh workflow run stale-bot-pr-notify.yml` |
| `../dependabot.yml` | Not a workflow — read directly by GitHub's Dependabot service | No manual run; check **Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot** |

## Setup

- Add repo secret `SECURITY_ALERTS_SLACK_WEBHOOK` (a Slack incoming webhook URL) — required by `security-findings-notify.yml` and `stale-bot-pr-notify.yml`.
- Optional repo variables to override defaults: `SECURITY_SLA_CRITICAL_DAYS` (15), `SECURITY_SLA_HIGH_DAYS` (30), `STALE_BOT_PR_DAYS` (3).

## How it works

### PRs are opened by Dependabot's own service, not by any workflow here

`dependabot.yml` is not a workflow — it's a config file that GitHub's Dependabot backend reads directly. None of the 3 workflow files in this directory ever open a PR; they only act on PRs that already exist.

Dependabot re-scans on the `schedule: interval` set per ecosystem block, and once immediately whenever `dependabot.yml` itself changes on the default branch. Per ecosystem (`bun`, `npm` for kilo-docs, `gradle` for kilo-jetbrains), it checks each dependency for updates, classifies each as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`, bundles everything matching a `groups: *-minor-patch` rule into one combined PR, and opens every major bump as its own individual PR. These are normal PRs from that point on — required CI and branch protection apply like any other PR.

### The 3 workflows each poll independently on their own schedule

They don't call each other or trigger off PR creation. Each one wakes up on its own cron and reads whatever state currently exists on GitHub:

| Workflow | Wakes up | Reads | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` | Hourly | Open `app/dependabot` PRs with a grouped `*-minor-patch` title | Enables GitHub's native auto-merge flag if every changed file besides shared `bun.lock` is under a `kilo`-named path; otherwise leaves it and logs a warning. |
| `security-findings-notify.yml` | Every 6h | GitHub's Dependabot **Alerts** (the vulnerability list, separate from the PR list above) | Posts new/at-risk/breached critical & high alerts to Slack, independent of whether a fix PR exists. |
| `stale-bot-pr-notify.yml` | Daily, 13:00 UTC | All open bot-authored PRs (not limited to Dependabot) | Flags any that are conflicting or long-unreviewed to Slack. |

### Enabling auto-merge isn't the same as merging

`dependabot-auto-merge.yml` only flips a flag on the PR. GitHub itself completes the merge later, automatically, once both the required human approval and all required status checks pass. If either never happens, the PR just sits with auto-merge armed but unfulfilled — nothing forces it through.

## Fork-safety notes

kilocode is a fork of opencode sharing one `bun.lock` with upstream-owned `@opencode-ai/*` packages. Two things exist specifically to avoid friction with upstream syncs:

- `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` only auto-merges a PR if every changed file (besides the shared `bun.lock`) lives under a `kilo`-named path. Anything touching shared/upstream code is left for a human.
- `dependabot.yml` deliberately does **not** cover `packages/opencode/Dockerfile` or `.github/workflows/**`: both are shared/upstream paths that the auto-merge guard above would never approve anyway, and `.github/workflows/**` changes routinely fail this repo's `kilocode_change` annotation check unless they land inside an existing marker block. Those paths are covered by `security-findings-notify.yml` instead, which only reads GitHub's alerts, it never proposes a PR.
